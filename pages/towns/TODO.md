## Town Graph Improvements

If you are reading this, then you're the perfect candidate to improve the Town
Graph! Here are some ways in which you could contribute:

-   Use terms to translate the graph into other languages.
-   Add share button and sync URL with build.
-   Add building sizes like S/M/L to the data
    (so that we can calculate needed town size).
-   Calculate needed income for achieving build.
-   Calculate recruitment costs and growth statistics
    (e.g., how long before you max the stack).
